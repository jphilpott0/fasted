# fasted:

Fasted ("**Fast** **e**dit **d**istance") is a WIP edit distance library written
in x86-64 Assembly and Rust optimised for processing batches of short to medium
length strings in parallel.

This is in active development and will continue to be updated over the coming weeks.
Presently, the preprocessing stage and allocator have been written. The remaining
components have been designed and will be implemented shortly.
